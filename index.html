				<p>We live in an increasingly digital world; Who we are, who our friends are, what we like, what we don’t, everything is stored and processed online with our personal devices as a gateway. Our lives are determined by our interaction with software and our interaction with others through software.<br/><br/>
					A computer engineer creates solutions that fit specifications and deliver on expectations, but human interpretation is often overlooked. An artist builds a product that induces emotions and conveys a message. To an artist, understanding interpretation is key to success. Influential software and hardware must be aware of its user and the world it exists in.<br/><br/>
					Any Solution can fulfill requirements.<br />Elegant solutions can change the world.<br/>
